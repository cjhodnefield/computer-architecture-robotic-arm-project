Imp Arm Project

This project provides code to control a robotic arm assembly through an Electric Imp (Agent2/Device2), as well as code for a second Imp (Agent1/Device1) that reads values from a set of potentiometers. The second Imp sends translated readings to the arm control Imp to operate the servos on the arm. This means that the robotic arm can be controlled remotely by the potentiometer setup over the internet.

The agent and device code for both Imps uses class structure to allowe any number of potentiometers and servos to be connected to their respective Imps (within the pin limits of the Imp of course) and use the same code for operation.

The .ai file on this GitHub is the file that we used to cut out the parts for the arm using a laser cutter at HAL. A link to a video of the laser cutter is listed below as well.
