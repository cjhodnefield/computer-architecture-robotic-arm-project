Imp Arm Project

This project provides code to control a robotic arm assembly through an Electric Imp (Agent2/Device2), as well as code for a second Imp (Agent1/Device1) that reads from potentiometers and sends a translated value to the arm control Imp. What this means is that the robotic arm can be controlled remotely by the potentiometer setup over the internet.
